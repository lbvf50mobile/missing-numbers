## Find unknown amount of missing numbers in an Unordered Array.

We have a big list having values from 1 to n, occuring only once but unordered with an unknown amount of missing values.

```
[8,10,11,7,3,15,6,1,14,5,12] ---> [2,4,9,13]
```  

As this is a hardcore version, the tests are prepared only algorithms of time coplexity O(n) to pass. As the spead of each language are diffrent, we will have different maximun lenght of the input. Features of the random tests:

```
1000 <= length of arrays <= 14.000.000
1 <= ammount of missing numbers <= 10
```
